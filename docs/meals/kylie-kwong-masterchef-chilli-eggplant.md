### Makes

serves 4-6 as part of shared meal

## Ingredients

* 2 medium eggplants, trimmed, halved 
* 5 tbs peanut oil 
* 1/2 bunch coriander leaves, stems and roots, finely sliced 
* 3 spring onions, finely sliced 
* 1 tsp Sichuan pepper and salt

Chili sauce:

* 1/2 cup peanut oil 
* 6 long red chillies, roughly chopped 
* 10 garlic cloves, roughly chopped 
* 7cm piece ginger, roughly chopped 
* 1 tbs tamari soy sauce

Sichuan pepper and salt:

* 1 tbs Sichuan peppercorns 
* 3 tbs sea salt flakes

## Method

1. Cut eggplant into 5cm irregular and same-sized pieces, then sprinkle well with sea salt and spread onto a tray in one layer. Set aside for at least 30 minutes. Rinse well, then drain and pat dry with paper towel. 

2. To make the chilli sauce, heat the oil in a wok until the surface seems to shimmer slightly. Add chillies, garlic and ginger and stir constantly over medium heat for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook, still stirring, for a further 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, then stir through the tamari. 

3. Dry-roast peppercorns and salt in small heavy-based frying pan until the peppercorns are fragrant and begin to 'pop'. Remove from the heat. Allow to cool, then grind to a powder in a mortar and pestle or spice grinder. (You can store the mixture in an airtight container). 

4. Heat the peanut oil in a wok until the surface seems to shimmer slightly. Add eggplant and stir-fry over high heat for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium and stir-fry for a further 5-7 minutes or until eggplant is tender. 

5. Add the chilli sauce to the eggplant and stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the coriander and spring onions, tossing to combine. 

6. Transfer to a large serving plate and season with Sichuan pepper and salt. Serve immediately.
