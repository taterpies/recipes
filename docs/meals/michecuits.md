# Miche's Biscuits

For 10 very large biscuits to be baked in a 12” cast iron pan. If you have a 10” pan either hav,e a supplementary baking sheet to use for 2-3 extra biscuits, freeze your 2-3 extra biscuits on a sheet pan then wrap individually in plastic wrap for instabiscuits, or scale the recipe below to 2/3.

### Makes

~6 biscuits if 1.5" high pre-bake:

## Ingredients

1 stick / 8 tbsp unsalted butter, cold
220 g all purpose flour (I like White Lily for biscuits, doesn’t have to be though)
1 tsp salt
1/2 T baking powder
3/8 tsp baking soda
3/4 cup buttermilk (whole milk buttermilk if possible or at least not nonfat)
+
Another 2 oz butter (the more the merrier)

## Method

Stick a your cast iron pan (a baking sheet would also work if that’s what you have to work with) into the oven and turn to 425 F to preheat. 

Cut butter into small cubes. If working from a stick, cut the stick lengthwise in half twice to form 4 skinny sticks, then cutting the sticks into cubes. Stick butter back into fridge while the oven heats up.

Once the oven is ready or near ready, optionally melt half of the extra butter and set aside. Whisk together the dry ingredients.

Toss the butter cubes with the flour mixture, then use the tips of your fingers to work the butter into the flour by pinching them flat. Toss everything with your finger tips every now and then so you can find the pieces of butter that still need working in. You want to work quickly and form a lot of flat flakes of butter with all surface areas of butter exposed to the flour. some of your butter will form smaller pea sized and crumbly bits but as long as you have some of those flakes remaining that is good. Do not overwork the butter into the dough. If you see the flour mixture turning a lot more yellow in cover and everything is too crumbly that is a sign the butter has been overworked. Your biscuits won’t be as flaky but will still be good and you may add less buttermilk.

Measure out your buttermilk but don’t put it away since depending on environmental factors and your flour, you may need to add more. Add most of the buttermilk but not all in case you don’t need it all and toss the flour to start mixing with the buttermilk, but don’t mix hard or knead it, just toss and gently mix with your hand to see how much buttermilk the flour absorbs. If everything looks fairly wet and hydrated, you’re good, if there are clumps of dry bits, keep adding buttermilk until there are none.

Sprinkle flour on a work surface and turn your dough onto the flour, then sprinkle more flour on top. It should be fairly wet and look unwieldy. Pat it a little flat and then use a bench/dough scraper to scrape and fold the dough in somewhat of thirds. Add more flour as needed and continue scraping and folding a few times until the dough becomes more cohesive.

You can pat/roll the dough out and cut out biscuits for nice even looking ones but I rarely bother. Pat the dough out into a rough rectangle about about 10-12” long and 4-5” wide. Cut the dough in half lengthwise and then each half into 5 squareish pieces. Pat each square roughly into a round if desired (it’ll fit better in the cast iron that way but if you are baking on a sheet then whatev).

Fold to make layers.
SHOULD BE 2-3" high before bake!

Take the cast iron out of the oven and toss in the extra butter. If you had melted half of it, quickly transfer all your biscuits to the pan and brush the tops with butter. Or you can just toss all the extra butter in the pan and dip the tops of the biscuits in the melted butter in the pan before turning them right side up and arranging in the pan.

Top with a light sprinkle of a flaky salt like a maldon sea salt, swirl the pan so the butter is evenly distributed and put back in the oven.

Bake for 25 minutes.
